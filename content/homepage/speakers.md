#### Kirstie Whitaker
##### Programme Lead for Tools, Practices and Systems, The Alan Turing Institute

Kirstie Whitaker leads the Tools, Practices and Systems Research Programme at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) (London, UK). Her work covers a broad range of interests and methods, but the driving principle is to improve the lives of neurodivergent people and people with mental health conditions. Dr Whitaker uses magnetic resonance imaging to study child and adolescent brain development and participatory citizen science to educate non-autistic people about how they can better support autistic friends and colleagues. She is the lead developer of [*The Turing Way*](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way), an openly developed educational resource to enable more reproducible data science. Kirstie is a passionate advocate for making science "open for all" by promoting equity and inclusion for people from diverse backgrounds, and by changing the academic incentive structure to reward collaborative working. She is the chair of the Turing Institute's Ethics Advisory Group, a Fulbright scholarship alumna and was a 2016/17 [Mozilla Fellow for Science](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ScienceLab). Kirstie was named, with her collaborator Petra Vertes, as a [2016 Global Thinker](https://2016globalthinkers.foreignpolicy.com/2016/profile/petra-vertes-and-kirstie-whitaker?3fa4cfa909=) by Foreign Policy magazine.
