#### Emily Sena
##### Stroke Association Kirby Laing Foundation Senior Lecturer, University of Edinburgh
##### Editor-in-Chief, BMJ Open Science

Dr Sena is a Stroke Association Kirby Laing Foundation Senior Non-Clinical Lecturer in the Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh.
She completed her undergraduate and postdoctoral degrees in Pharmacology and Neuroscience at the Universities of Edinburgh and Melbourne.
She is specialised in the validity of preclinical research and a passionate advocate for open science. Her research interests are in the use of meta-research approaches (research on research) to drive improvements in the validity, transparency and reproducibility of primary research using animal models of human diseases. Her work has informed laboratory practice guidelines, editorial policy and clinical trials design.
Emily is the inaugural Editor-in-Chief of BMJ Open Science, and convenor of CAMARADES - an international collaboration that supports, advances and undertakes systematic reviews of preclinical research.

#### Kirstie Whitaker
##### Programme Lead for Tools, Practices and Systems, The Alan Turing Institute

Kirstie Whitaker leads the Tools, Practices and Systems Research Programme at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) (London, UK). Her work covers a broad range of interests and methods, but the driving principle is to improve the lives of neurodivergent people and people with mental health conditions. Dr Whitaker uses magnetic resonance imaging to study child and adolescent brain development and participatory citizen science to educate non-autistic people about how they can better support autistic friends and colleagues. She is the lead developer of [*The Turing Way*](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way), an openly developed educational resource to enable more reproducible data science. Kirstie is a passionate advocate for making science "open for all" by promoting equity and inclusion for people from diverse backgrounds, and by changing the academic incentive structure to reward collaborative working. She is the chair of the Turing Institute's Ethics Advisory Group, a Fulbright scholarship alumna and was a 2016/17 [Mozilla Fellow for Science](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ScienceLab). Kirstie was named, with her collaborator Petra Vertes, as a [2016 Global Thinker](https://2016globalthinkers.foreignpolicy.com/2016/profile/petra-vertes-and-kirstie-whitaker?3fa4cfa909=) by Foreign Policy magazine. You can find more information at her lab website: [whitakerlab.github.io](https://whitakerlab.github.io/).

#### Ulrich Dirnagl
##### Director, Department of Experimental Neurology, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin
##### Founding Director, BIG Quest Center for Transforming Biomedical Research

In preclinical as well as in clinical studies Ulrich Dirnagl’s research has revealed pathobiology which impact on the outcome after a stroke. These include deleterious as well as endogenous protective mechanisms, as interactions of the brain with other systems of the body after it has been injured. Several of these mechanism can be therapeutically targeted, clinical trials are under way. In addition, through meta-research he was able to identify opportunities for improving research practice and to obtain evidence for the impact of interventions targeted to increase the value of biomedical research. At the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin Ulrich Dirnagl serves as Director of the Department of Experimental Neurology. Since 2017 he is also the founding director of the QUEST Center for Transforming Biomedical Research at the Berlin Institute of Health. QUEST aims at overcoming the roadblocks in translational medicine by increasing the value and impact of biomedical research through maximizing the quality, reproducibility, generalizability, and validity of research.
